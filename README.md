# React Shopping Cart

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using React and Redux Toolkit. It allows users to browse through a list of products, filter them based on categories, and add/remove items to/from the shopping cart. Additionally, users can increment or decrement the quantity of each item in the cart. The cart is cleared upon checkout, and the user is redirected to a success page.
